Non-intrusive monitoring may be applied to power quality, load
diagnosis, faulty appliance detection or with excessive energy
consumption and energy efficiency. This work will discuss the
technology developed when addressing the issue of energy efficiency
for the residential sector. The transient event detection is its
focus, where it was used a Gaussian core filter to obtain the
responsive regions which indicates an appliance state change. The
approach parameters were optimize via genetic algorithm. In order to
improve the problem comprehension, it was used Self-Organizing Maps to
explore the disturbance chracteristics due to an appliance state
change. They were also evaluated as an method to aid increasing previous
methodology efficiency. Detection rates higher than 84\% for false
alarm rates lower than 16\% were achieved while in a pratical scenario
application.
